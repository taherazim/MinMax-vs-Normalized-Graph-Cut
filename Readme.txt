The attached code is the implementation of the algorithms of below papers:
1)A Min-Max algorithm for Graph Partioning and Data Clustering 
    -Chris H.Q. Ding", Xiaofeng He",*, Hongyuan Zhab, Ming Gu', Horst D. Simon"
2)Normalized Cuts and Image Segmentation ,Jianbo Shi and Jitendra Malik.


Dataset choosen for the implementation can be found on below link:
 https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/data/20_newsgroups.tar.gz

The dataset contains 20 different newsgroup each with 1000 docs.

For this implementation, Atheism and Graphics newsgroup were choosen.

atheismfilename.csv and graphicsfilename.csv each contains 5 columns with filesname of 200 random docs.
